Empy
====

Empy is a simple [DashClock](https://code.google.com/p/dashclock/) extension that reports information about the color of the lights atop the Empire State Building in NYC.

Background
----------

The lights on the Empire State Building frequently change colors to pay homage to various cultural and political happenings. As a New Yorker, people often ask me if I know why it's colored the way it is on a certain night, and I got tired of never knowing the answer. As a huge fan of DashCLock, this seemed like the best way to solve my problem.

Additionally, this is the first Android project that I've ever worked on solo and I would gladly welcome feedback of any kind.

Plans
-----

I aim to polish this up a bit and eventually release it on Google Play. I could probably use some help with the assets.
